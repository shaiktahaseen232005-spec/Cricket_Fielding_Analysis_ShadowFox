# Cricket_Fielding_Analysis_ShadowFox
🚀 Advanced Task Completed – ShadowFox Data Science Internship 🚀
I am excited to share that I have successfully completed the Advanced Level Task of my Data Science Internship with ShadowFox.
🔹 Task Focus: Cricket Fielding Performance Analysis
The objective of this project was to create a ball-by-ball fielding dataset, compute player-wise Performance Scores (PS) using a weighted formula, and visualize insights to identify top performers.
🔹 Work Done:
Created a structured dataset (cricket_fielding.csv) in Google Sheets with ball-level fielding details.
Cleaned and processed the data in Google Colab using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Generated indicator features for catches, run-outs, drops, fumbles, and runs saved.
Applied a weighted Performance Score formula to rank players fairly.
Built visualizations (bar charts, tables) to highlight top performers.
Added 2–3 line summaries per top player with interpretation and recommendations.

🔹 Outcome / Learning:
Learned how to design and build a custom dataset from scratch.
Applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and scoring techniques to sports analytics.
Understood how player fielding contributions can be quantified using data-driven insights.
